This is a desktop version of my cafe manager. It includes the ability to purchace a variety of donuts, purchase different kinds of coffee, and place orders. Additionally, it can export a list of current orders to a text file. For a more in-depth explanation be sure to check out the video linked above.

Comments may be a bit excessive due to project guidelines.
